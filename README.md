# Automatic Edge search for Microsoft Rewards

- This is a simple python script that automatically performs the 30 searches in edge browser as required to get all the daily search points.

- This can come in handy if you do not use microsoft edge as your default browser for whatever reason you have just like me or you do not use the internet enough to complete 30 searches.

> But do keep in mind that this will take some time to complete. So you need to have some patience.

- This will take approx 2 minutes to complete all the 30 searches.

## Running the Script

- make sure you have python 3.6 or above installed.
- then you just need to run this edge_search.py file and then wait and watch.
- The script automatically closes edge after performing 10 searches and then re-opens, this is done so that a pc with low RAM does not crash because of opening 90 tabs at a time.

> - **If at any point of time want to close the script just go to the terminal and hit the `ctrl+c` key. This will force kill the script.** or **simply close vs code**.
